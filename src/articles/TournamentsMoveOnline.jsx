            Unfortunately this is not the case for all the tournament series in SoCal. 
            Many of which have announced a hiatus until things get back to normal.
            Smash.gg has even began planning a fundraiser to help support these tournament
            organizers who've already invested in tournament that won't be happening.

            We're living in a new reality in which the future of competitive Smash and other fighting game communities are uncertain.
            Here's to hoping that everyone remains healthy and safe and when in-person tournaments start again I hope everyone took advantage of this time to get in the lab ðŸ’ª.
